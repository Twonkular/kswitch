# kswitch

A simple command line tool for light/dark theme switching in KDE Plasma.

## Features

- Command line interface to set or toggle theme
- Easy to configure a keyboard shortcut â€” just make a keyboard shortcut for `kswitch toggle`
- Configurable through a simple config file (`~/.config/kswitch/config.toml` by default)
- Switches Konsole default theme and also updates theme for all open Konsole instances
- Synchronous, multithreaded design for smoother transitions

## Installation Instructions

### Dependencies

- KDE Plasma (tested on 6.3.5)
- `dbus` and `qdbus` for interfacing with KDE components
- Rust (for building from source)
- `cargo` for installation

### From Source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kswitch
cd kswitch
cargo install --path .
```

## Usage

```sh
kswitch toggle         # Toggle between light and dark themes
kswitch set light      # Force light mode
kswitch set dark       # Force dark mode
kswitch config edit    # Open config in your default editor
```

You can create a custom keyboard shortcut in KDE System Settings to run `kswitch toggle`.

## Configuration

`kswitch` uses a simple TOML config file located at:

```
~/.config/kswitch/config.toml
```

It includes paths and names of your preferred themes, wallpapers, etc. The config can be created or edited via:

```sh
kswitch config edit
```

## Warnings

- Currently tested only on **KDE Plasma 6.3.5** (Manjaro Linux).
- Functionality may vary or break on other Plasma versions or KDE-based environments.
- Use at your own risk and backup your theme settings.

## Contributions

Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests. Cannot promise I will look at them. Did this for myself to help learn Rust.

## Existing solutions

Take a look at [koi](https://github.com/baduhai/Koi) and [YinYang](https://github.com/oskarsh/Yin-Yang). These do similar things, but there is no way to create a keyboard shortcut in Koi, and YinYang feels slow. Neither offer theme switching on Konsole sessions.
